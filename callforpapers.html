            <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
            <p class="subtitle"><strong>Theme:</strong> Ten Years of GDPR – Engineering the Future</p>
            
            <p>Ten years after the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this EU legal framework together with the technical developments remains the global point of reference for empowering individuals and ensuring a high-level of protection in terms of privacy. However, the challenges of the next decade look very different from the last. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence, data-driven business models and governmental practices, and complex digital services are testing the limits of established privacy norms in Europe and beyond. APF 2026 invites the community to contribute to the understanding of what is at stake, where new threats originate, and how law, technology, and practice can be integrated to address current and imminent challenges.</p>
            <p>Against this background, RSAC™ Conference, the University of Salzburg, and Goethe University Frankfurt jointly organize the Annual Privacy Forum (APF) 2026 in Salzburg, Austria.</p>

            <p>For the <strong>APF 2026</strong>, we invite papers presenting original work on the themes of data protection and privacy and their repercussions on technology, business, government, law, society, policy and law enforcement. An interdisciplinary approach is highly encouraged to contribute to bridging the gap between research, business models and policy.</p>
            
            <p>APF 2026 seeks original contributions from researchers and academia, policy makers and implementers, data protection authorities, industry, consultants, NGOs, as well as civil society.
                Full research papers need to be genuine in content and should not overlap with work published elsewhere. 
                Opinion papers are expected to reflect the views of the author(s). Submissions can be up to 8000 words, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices.
