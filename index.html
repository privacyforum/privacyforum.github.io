            <h2>Annual Privacy Forum</h2>
            <p>The value of personal data in the online world has significantly increased over the last years as
                electronic products, services and processes have permeated every fold of everyday life. Limitations in
                the transparency, the functionality and interconnectivity of online and communication services increases
                the risk of having personal data processed out of control of any accountable person or organization or
                simply becoming exposed to all sorts of privacy threats.</p>
            <p>The EU legal framework on personal data protection is key in an effort to better control the processing
                of personal data while ensuring an adequate level of protection. Even the best legislative efforts
                cannot keep up to speed with the pace of innovative technology and business models that challenge the
                way personal data is processed and privacy is protected across the EU and beyond; therefore, examining
                what is at stake and where threats thereto originate from becomes of paramount importance</p>

            <p>This year's conference theme <i>Ten Years of GDPR – Engineering the Future</i> reflects both on the
                existing EU legal framework as a cornerstone for empowering individuals as well as on the future of
                personal data protection.
                A decade after the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this EU legal framework
                together with the technical developments remains the global point of reference for empowering
                individuals and ensuring a high level of protection in terms of privacy.
                However, the challenges of the next decade look very different from the last.
                Rapid advances in artificial intelligence, data-driven business models and governmental practices, and
                complex digital services are testing the limits of established privacy norms in Europe and beyond.
                In line with previous editions, the conference brings together privacy and data protection researchers,
                policymakers, lawyers, technology experts, and activists to discuss current trends and developments in
                data protection.
