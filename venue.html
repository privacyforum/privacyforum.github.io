        <h3>Reaching Salzburg</h3>
        Salzburg is located in the heart of Europe. Therefore, it is easily reachable by train, long distance bus and airplane.
        While Salzburg has a lot of direct connections, you can also travel via Vienna or Munich (Germany).

        <h4>Access by Train</h4>
        <p>
            Salzburg main station is well-connected to the European neighbors. 
            Moreover, it is both part of the Austrian train network and endpoint of the German train network. Therefore, it is reachable with the Klimaticket or Deutschlandticket free of charge. 
            Check prices both with the Austrian train providers <a href="https://fahrplan.oebb.at/webapp/#!P|TP!H|473083" target="_blank">ÖBB</a>, <a href="https://westbahn.at/en/" target="_blank">Westbahn</a> and the German train provider <a href="https://www.bahn.de/" target="_blank">DB</a>!

        <h4>Mobility in Salzburg</h4>
        <p>
            Within Salzburg, the guest mobility ticket is granted for all overnight guests and gives you access to all public transport tickets within the entire province of Salzburg. 
            The ticket allows travel on city and regional buses, suburban trains, regional and long distance trains, as well as micro public transport connections, ensuring sustainable, stress free mobility within Salzburg.
            The ticket is financed by a mobility charge of € 0.50 per night. The contribution is added to the accommodation tax, and the revenues are earmarked for public transport.
